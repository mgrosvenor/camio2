Requires: make, g++, ccache, python

Installation:

cake.conf needs to be installed as /etc/cake.conf  
Currently cake is hard-coded to look up /etc/cake.conf and as such is not relocatable. I know, this is bad. 
    cp cake.conf /etc/cake.conf

cake needs to be installed in the executables path, typically /usr/bin/ but this is relocatable.
    cp cake /usr/bin/cake

A man page and README can be produced by executing 
    ./create-documentation.sh
    
Copy the man page to somewhere useful and gzip it.  E.g, 
    cp cake.1 /usr/share/man/man1/cake.1
    gzip /usr/share/man/man1/cake.1
